Converting UpanishathChandrikaPart1.pdf to HTML:

Acrobat
	Can't export (some error). When removed most of pages, it can export (very slowly) but most characters are replaced by space.
mupdf-1.12.0-windows
	Seem to be confused about encoding (almost all symbols turn into U+FFFD), also loses actual font names (they turn into T1, T2, T3...).
pdftohtml-0.39
	Can only handle PDF-1.6, and hit is PDF-1.5 (or something like that)
pdf2htmlEX-win32-0.14.6-upx-with-poppler-data
	Most chars are ignored (mostly "[", "]" etc remain).
	Also: Internal Error: Attempt to output 2147483647 into a 16-bit field. It will be truncated and the file may not be useful.
poppler-0.51 (pdftohtml.exe)
	The only tool to extract useable text from PDF as is: all latin-baser chars are readable and devanagari are somewhat close to what we had from VayuStuti. But it doesn't extract any formatting at all (bold or latin are not marked).
poppler-0.60.1 (from MikTeX windows distribution): same as poppler-0.51
